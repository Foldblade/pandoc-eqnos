What is this? $$ y = mx + b \qquad (1)$$ Equation 1 describes a straight
line.

More generally, the equation for a polynomial is $$ \begin{aligned}
     y &= a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \dots \\
     &= \sum_i a_i x^i
   \end{aligned}
\qquad (2)$$

Equations 1--2 are known to all math students.

Equations like $$ y = A e^{-\gamma t}\cos(2\pi f t) $$ can be left
unnumbered if we do not need to refer to them. It is also possible to
number equations generically without planning to refer to them; e.g.:
$$ \pi = 3.141592653589793238462643\dots \qquad (3)$$ and
$$ e =   2.718281828459045235360287\dots \qquad (4)$$
