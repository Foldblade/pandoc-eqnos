The equation for a straight line is
\begin{equation} y = mx + b \label{eq:line}\end{equation} and the
equation for a polynomial is \begin{equation} \begin{aligned}
     y &= a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \dots \\
     &= \sum_i a_i x^i
   \end{aligned}
\label{eq:polynomial}\end{equation}

Equations \ref{eq:line} and \ref{eq:polynomial} are known to all math
students. Notice that

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Equation \ref{eq:line} is a special case of Eq. \ref{eq:polynomial};
  and
\item
  Equation \ref{eq:polynomial} is a Maclaurin series.
\end{enumerate}

Equations \ref{eq:line}--\ref{eq:polynomial} are used throughout science
and engineering.

Equations like \[ y = A e^{-\gamma t}\cos(2\pi f t) \] can be left
unnumbered if we do not need to refer to them. It is also possible to
number equations generically without planning to refer to them; e.g.:
\begin{equation} \pi = 3.141592653589793238462643\dots \label{eq:__-1053774000882284256__}\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation} e =   2.718281828459045235360287\dots \label{eq:__2430461880868312730__}\end{equation}
