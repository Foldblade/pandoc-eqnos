What is this? \begin{equation} y = mx + b \label{eq:line}\end{equation}
Equation \ref{eq:line} describes a straight line.

More generally, the equation for a polynomial is
\begin{equation} \begin{aligned}
     y &= a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \dots \\
     &= \sum_i a_i x^i
   \end{aligned}
\label{eq:polynomial}\end{equation}

Equations \ref{eq:line}--\ref{eq:polynomial} are known to all math
students.

Equations like \[ y = A e^{-\gamma t}\cos(2\pi f t) \] can be left
unnumbered if we do not need to refer to them. It is also possible to
number equations generically without planning to refer to them; e.g.:
\begin{equation} \pi = 3.141592653589793238462643\dots \label{eq:__6943075502524592249__}\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation} e =   2.718281828459045235360287\dots \label{eq:__-2136475774652521989__}\end{equation}
